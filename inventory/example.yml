# Example inventory structure explanations üìù
#
# 1. Controller Setup:
#    - Minimum of 3 controllers recommended for HA
#    - Each controller needs unique name
#    - All controllers should be reachable via load balancer
#
# 2. Worker Setup:
#    - Workers can be "ingress", "egress", or both
#    - Ingress workers should be in DMZ network
#    - Egress workers should be in private network
#
# 3. Security Notes:
#    - Use ansible-vault for sensitive variables
#    - TLS certificates required for production
#    - Vault KMS integration recommended
#
# 4. Network Requirements:
#    - Controllers: ports 9200-9203
#    - Workers: port 9202
#    - Database: port 5432 (PostgreSQL)
